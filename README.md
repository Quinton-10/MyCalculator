# MyCalculator
##a Calculator for simple calculations
In this project I made a simple calculator that prints a welcome message with a set of instructions to assist the user.
I used the eval() built in function that allows you to evaluate arbitrary Python expresions from a string based or compiled-code-based input.
The program asks the user to enter their calculation and it calculates it for them, after the answer is printed they can either choose to continue or exit the program if they do not select a valid value they the program will Exit.
